## I'm Roy 😊
Python developer building polished apps, dashboards, and user-friendly tools.

I'm transitioning into software development after years of real-world experience in logistics, data handling, and frontline services.
Now I am focusing on creating clean and reliable Python applications that solve problems with thoughtful UI design and solid backend structure.

---

## 👨🏽‍🔬 I am currently working on 
- A **UK Population Tracker Dashboard** A full analytics platform built with Django, powered by synthetic demographic               generated uaing Faker and Mimesis. The backend will use Polars for high performance population modelling, GeoPandas for       UK regional mapping and MongoDB for storing the all the data.
- I am also continuing to refine my existing apps with better UI Design, improved structure, and  more robust testing.
